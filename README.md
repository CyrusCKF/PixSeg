# ✨ PixSeg

![prediction](./doc/assets/prediction_hstack.gif)

Pixel segmentation (a.k.a. semantic segmentation) is a task to classify each pixel in an image into a class.  
This project is a lightweight and easy-to-use package for pixel segmentation. It provides a PyTorch implementation of various deep learning components, such as models, pretrained weights, datasets, loss functions, and more.

## 🌟 Highlights

- **Plug & Play** 🎯 - Integrate custom models, datasets, and other components with a *PyTorch*-like interface
- **Lightweight** 👾 - Requires only *PyTorch* (torch & torchvision) as dependencies in the standard version
- **Fully Featured** 🧰 - Offers visualization tools, evaluation metrics and data transformation utilities tailored for semantic segmentation
- **Extensible** 🎨 - Easily register components for training configurations
- **Logging** 📷 - Logs hyperparameters and results across platforms like local storage, Weights & Biases, TensorBoard

## 🏃 Kickoff 

There are **3 ways** to start using this project.

### *Option 1* 💎 Use `torch.hub`

This method lets you use models and pre-trained weights **without installation**. See [*here*](#models) for available models and pretrained weights.

```python
import torch
print(torch.hub.list("CyrusCKF/PixSeg", force_reload=True, trust_repo=True))
print(torch.hub.help("CyrusCKF/PixSeg", "bisenet_resnet18"))
model = torch.hub.load("CyrusCKF/PixSeg", "bisenet_resnet18", weights="DEFAULT")
```

For more details, refer to [doc/using_hub.ipynb](doc/using_hub.ipynb).  
As this project shares the same interface as *TorchVision*, you may also check the [official documentation](<https://pytorch.org/docs/main/hub.html>) or [Using models from Hub](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models.html#using-models-from-hub) on how to use vision models via PyTorch Hub.

### *Option 2* 💖 Import as package

To install the package, run `pip install pixseg`  
This includes models, datasets, loss functions, and utility modules. For examples, see [*here*](#usage-examples).

Optionally, for config and trainer system, run `pip install pixseg[full]`  

### *Option 3* 💠 Clone this project

1. Clone this repo by `git clone https://github.com/CyrusCKF/PixSeg.git`
2. Create new environment and install PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>
3. Install dependencies in editable mode by `pip install -e .[dev]`
4. For more usage, see [*here*](#usage-examples).

## 👀 Usage examples

Here shows examples for when you clone this project (*Option 3*). The same concepts apply for installing it as package (*Option 2*)

### Dataset and its info 🧮

```python
from pathlib import Path
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from src.pixseg.datasets import ADE20K, resolve_metadata
from src.pixseg.utils.transform import SegmentationTransform

root = Path(r"path/to/ADE20K")
# Preset metadata of ADE20K, which includes labels, background index, etc
metadata = resolve_metadata("ADE20K")
# Make sure the data is formatted correctly for model input
transforms = SegmentationTransform(size=(512, 512), mask_fill=metadata.ignore_index)
dataset = ADE20K(root, split="training", transforms=transforms)
train_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4, drop_last=True, shuffle=True)
```

### Network components 🧠

```python
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import PolynomialLR
from src.pixseg.learn import DiceLoss, Padam
from src.pixseg.models import PSPNET_ResNet50_Weights, pspnet_resnet50
from src.pixseg.utils.transform import SegmentationAugment

# Create PSPNet with ResNet-50 backbone and enable auxiliary loss
model = pspnet_resnet50(num_classes=metadata.num_classes, aux_loss=True)
# Or initialize with pretrained weights
model = pspnet_resnet50(weights=PSPNET_ResNet50_Weights.DEFAULT)
criterion = DiceLoss(ignore_index=metadata.ignore_index)
optimizer = Padam(model.parameters(), lr=0.1, weight_decay=5e-4, partial=0.125)
lr_scheduler = PolynomialLR(optimizer, total_iters=100, power=0.9)
```

### Training loop and utils 🔁

Utils are supplementary functions that enhance training loops. Below is a brief example of how to use them.

```python
from torch import Tensor
from src.pixseg.utils.metrics import MetricStore
from src.pixseg.utils.rng import seed
from src.pixseg.utils.visual import exhibit_figure, plot_confusion_matrix

# Fix random seeds of random, numpy and pytorch
seed(42)
# This project separates data transforms and data augmentations, so that visualizations can show the original images
train_augment = SegmentationAugment(hflip=0.5, mask_fill=metadata.ignore_index)
for i in range(100):  # Set your number of epochs
    model.train()
    # Store and calculate metrics efficiently
    train_ms = MetricStore(metadata.num_classes)
    for j, (images, masks) in enumerate(train_loader):
        images, masks = train_augment(images, masks)
        ...
        logits: dict[str, Tensor] = model(images)
        train_ms.store_results(masks, logits["out"].argmax(1))
        ...

    # Print training results
    print(train_ms.summarize())
    # Visualize confusion matrix and save as image
    plot_confusion_matrix(train_ms.confusion_matrix, metadata.labels)
    exhibit_figure(show=False, save_to=Path("confusion_matrix.png"))
```

### More on usage 🛠️

For general information about using models and pretrained weights, you may refere to <https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models.html#general-information-on-pre-trained-weights>, which shares the same interface. This section [Using models from Hub](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/models.html#using-models-from-hub) explains how to use models via PyTorch Hub.

You may check [tasks/minimal_training.ipynb](tasks/minimal_training.ipynb) to see how to implement a simple training and evaluation loop. Pretrained weights and their training details are available in the [*Release*](https://github.com/CyrusCKF/PixSeg/releases) sidebar. All of them are also exposed through enums in code.

If you installed the **full** version or cloned this project, visit [tasks/training.ipynb](tasks/training.ipynb) to learn how to start training with config and loggers. For config options, refer to [doc/config_doc.ipynb](doc/config_doc.ipynb). Moreover, [tasks/inference.ipynb](tasks/inference.ipynb) demonstrates a lot of functions to improve performance in test time.

### Model weights

Available in <https://github.com/CyrusCKF/PixSeg/releases>. The model files can be found inside the Assets tab. The specification of each pretrained model is shown.

In particular, *mIoU(tta)* means evaluating with these test-time augmentations: multi-scale of (0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5) x horizontal flip of both on and off. *MACs* is the number of multiply-accumulate operations. *Memory* and *MACs* are calculated with batch size of 1. *Time* is estimated using eval mode with batch size of 1 on RTX3070.

### Transforms

This project separates data transforms and data augmentations, so that visualizations can show the original images

- Data transforms

  Ensure images and targets are in the correct type and shape. See [source code](https://github.com/CyrusCKF/PixSeg/blob/main/src/pixseg/utils/transform.py#L132) of `SegmentationTransform` for details

- Data augmentations

  Provide a parametrised interface of common augmentations. See [source code](https://github.com/CyrusCKF/PixSeg/blob/main/src/pixseg/utils/transform.py#L164) of `SegmentationAugment` for details

### Metrics

Let $n$ be number of classes and $S_i$ be number of ground truths in class $i$, i.e. $S_i = TP_i + FN_i$. Denote total number of samples to be $S = \sum_{i=1}^n S_i = TP + TN + FP + FN$

```math
\begin{flalign}
\text{accuracy} &= \frac{TP}{S} && \newline
\text{mean accuracy} &= \frac{1}{n} \times \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{TP_i}{S_i} && \newline
\text{mean IoU} &= \frac{1}{n} \times \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{TP_i}{TP_i + FP_i + FN_i} && \newline
\text{frequency-weighted IoU} &= \frac{1}{S} \times \sum_{i=1}^n  S_i \times \frac{TP_i}{TP_i + TN_i + FP_i} && \newline
\text{Dice} &= \frac{1}{n} \times \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{2 \times TP_i}{2 \times TP_i + FP_i + FN_i} && \newline
\end{flalign}
```

### Loggers\*

Each logger contains different implmentations of hook to record results. See [Training outputs](#training-outputs) for the behaviour of each of them. All cexcept *Local* can be toggled off.

### Trainer\*

Combine components in each part to form a complete training loop, with evaluation after each epoch.

### Config\*

See [doc\sample_config.toml](doc\sample_config.toml) for config sample.  
See [doc\config_doc.ipynb](doc\config_doc.ipynb) for explanation of each field.

### Test time\*

Test-time augmentations and sliding window inference. Other techniques don't really do much. See [tasks\inference.ipynb](tasks\inference.ipynb) for demonstrations.  

\* Only available in the full version

## Training outputs

In the **\[full\]** version, trainer can record results locally or to various service providers. This previews the bahaviour of each logger. You may also implement your own.
